# Technical Challenge
This is project was created to solve a TEILUR technical test.

The goal is to access an API server called DUMMY-JSON and implement different interfaces to request and manipulate data information according to the specifications of this challenge.

# Need to Do

* Complete implementation of 3 interfaces called ProductService, CartService and UserService for requesting data via server API.

* Complete implementation a business interface called AppFeatures where exist 4 operations:
> 1. public abstract void getProductTitlesByWorseRating(double rating);
> 2. public astract Cart getCartWithHighestTotal();
> 3. public abstract Cart getCartWithLowestTotal();
> 4. public abstract List<Product> addProductImagesToUserCart(Integer userId);

# Tecnologies and Tools involved

The project was written in Java, Spring Framework and Maven. This project did not involve creating an API, just requesting its access.

This project was fully implemented using [OOP](https://github.com/AlexandreBartie/TEILUR-api-request-challenge/wiki/About-the-Project-Design) approaches and clean code.

The [Unit Test](https://github.com/AlexandreBartie/TEILUR-api-request-challenge/wiki/About-Unit-Testing) was created applying the Xunit library.

# Complete Java Server API

If you are interested in seeing how it is possible to create a complete API-Server using Java, Spring Framework, DataBase, Docker, Springdoc, Hateoas, Mapper, FasterXML, Auth0, Rest-Assured, Mockito, I have a complete Java project in my repository created by me for Java code training and API architecture.
